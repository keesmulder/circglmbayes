#' Basic Human Values data
#'
#' Data from Dutch respondents of the European Social Survey (ESS) on the Basic
#' Human Values scale (Schwartz, 2007).
#'
#' This dataset includes a circular outcome extracted from the Basic Human
#' Values scale. Note that the extraction of a single circular value as the most
#' salient human value is somewhat of an oversimplification from a theoretical
#' perspective. It is given here because it is nevertheless meaningful as well
#' as useful for illustration purposes.
#'
#' In addition to the circular outcome, some covariates are included. For
#' further details on the variables included, see the ESS documentation.
