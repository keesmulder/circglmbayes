Description: Perform a Bayesian analysis of a circular outcome General Linear
    Model (GLM), which allows regressing a circular outcome on linear and
    categorical predictors. Posterior samples are obtained by means of an MCMC
    algorithm written in 'C++' through 'Rcpp'. Estimation and credible intervals
    are provided, as well as hypothesis testing through Bayes Factors.
