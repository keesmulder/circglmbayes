Description: Perform a Bayesian analysis of a circular General Linear Model 
    (GLM), which allows regressing a circular outcome on linear and categorical 
    predictors. Posterior samples are obtained by means of an MCMC algorithm 
    written in C++ through Rcpp. Estimation and credible intervals are provided,
    as well as hypothesis testing through Bayes Factors.
